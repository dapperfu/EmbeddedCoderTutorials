# Embedded Coder Tutorials

*Audentes Fortuna Iuvat.*

> [Embedded Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder.html) offers built-in support for AUTOSAR, MISRA CÂ®, and ASAP2 software standards. It also provides traceability reports, code documentation, and automated software verification to support DO-178, IEC 61508, and ISO 26262 software development. Embedded Coder code is portable, and can be compiled and executed on any processor. In addition, Embedded Coder offers support packages with advanced optimizations and device drivers for specific hardware.

Documentation and tutorials are severely lacking. While Mathworks offers training and consulting services not everyone interested in learning about DO-178, IEC 61508, and ISO 26262 software development can get to them. Not everyone is a 'book learner'.

This set of tutorials is aimed at giving Simulink and Embedded Developers a crash course in developing for a new Embedded Target Environment.
